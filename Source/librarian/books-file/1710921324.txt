Button1 		Button2 		Button3

			Command

Left		Straight	Right		Reverse
redLED 		redLED 		redLED 		redLED 	
greenLED	greenLED	greenLED	greenLED

Create a circuit that will do the ff
1.) if the arduino is run all red lights will HIGH and green is LOW
	if the button1 pressed, Left greenLED will HIGH and all others RED will low , and if button is pullUp all red will HIGH
	if the button2 presed, Right  grreenLED will HIGH, all others RED will low, and if button is pullUP all red wil high
	if button 3 pressed, Reverse greenLED will High, and all others will LOW , then after 3 seconds , Right greenLED will green and all others redLED HIGH

	if button1 and button 2 pressed, Straight greenLED will High, all others redLED will HIGH.

Button1 = 5
button2 = 6
button3 = 7

Left = redLED = 3
 	greenLED = 2


Straight = redLED = 9	
	greenLED = 8

Right = redLED = 11	
	greenLED = 10

reverse = redLED = 13	
	greenLED = 12

CAN YOU CREATE AN ARDUINO CODE BASIC CODE FOR THIS
